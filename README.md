# Pinitiative

### Developers: [Jhantelle Belleza](https://github.com/jhantelleb), [Anthony Zeitlin](https://github.com/Zeitlin1), [Tameika Lawrence](https://github.com/tameika), and [Christopher Boynton](https://github.com/chrisb616).

Pinitiative is for the [The Opportunity Project](http://opportunity.census.gov/) using landmarks from the NYC Open Data.

The idea behind Pinitiative came from people interested in helping their community. We wanted to create an app that eased the social barrier in knowing or meeting people who have similar interests in solving community issues that they see day to day.
The app allows people to interact in a group based solely around an initiavite for which everyone shows passion.


## New to Pinitiative?
First time users of "Pinitiative" will log in and be brought to a map screen which shows the local landmarks in their area. These landmarks include schools, parks, hospitals, police stations, and firestations. Users can click on a landmark and create an "initiative" about something they care about. They alternatively, can long-click on the map to create an initiative anywhere on the map.

Other users will be able to see your initiatives and nearby initiatives. If they're interested, they can join and use the chat functionality to begin and organize your social change!

All of the developers on this team were students at [The Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) during the development of the project.
